## 1. Dependencies before cmake

### 1.1. IF USE AdaptiveCpp(known as OpenSYCL/hipSYCL, recommended)

- #### 1.1.1. install [boost-version-1.83](https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_83_0.html)(needed by AdaptiveCpp)
- #### 1.1.2. install [AdaptiveCpp](https://github.com/AdaptiveCpp/AdaptiveCpp), for how to install AdaptiveCpp: [different backends need different dependencies](https://github.com/jiuxiaocloud/uconfig/blob/master/3.7-opensycl(based%20boost).md)
- #### 1.1.3. add bin, libs and includes of AdaptiveCpp and dependencies to ENV PATHs
- #### 1.1.4. XFLUIDS use find_package(AdaptiveCpp) targetting AdaptiveCpp compile system, set cmake option AdaptiveCpp_DIR

  ````cmake
  cmake -DAdaptiveCpp_DIR=/path/to/AdaptiveCpp/lib/cmake/AdaptiveCpp ..
  ````
- #### Device discovery: exec "acpp-info" in cmd for device counting

  ```cmd
  $ acpp-info
  =================Backend information===================
  Loaded backend 0: OpenMP
    Found device: hipSYCL OpenMP host device
  Loaded backend 1: CUDA
    Found device: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070

  ```

### 1.2. IF USE Intel oneAPI(only recommended on Intel GPU platform)

- #### 1.1.1.[intel oneapi version &gt;= 2023.0.0](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/developer/tools/oneapi/base-toolkit-download.html?operatingsystem=linux&distributions=offline) as compiler
- #### 1.1.2.[codeplay Solutions for NVIDIA and AMD backends](https://codeplay.com/solutions/oneapi/) if GPU targets are needed
- #### 1.1.3.1.activate environment for oneAPI appended codeplay sultion libs

  ````bash
  source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh  --force --include-intel-llvm
  ````
- #### 1.2.3.2.or you can use the script files(only basic environments are included)

  ````bash
  source ./scripts/oneAPI/oneapi_base.sh
  ````
- #### 1.1.4.[libboost_filesystem](https://www.boost.org/users/history/version_1_83_0.html) as external lib while gcc internal filesystem is missing

- #### Device discovery: exec "sycl-ls" in cmd for device counting

  ```cmd
  $ sycl-ls
  [opencl:acc:0] Intel(R) FPGA Emulation Platform for OpenCL(TM), Intel(R) FPGA Emulation Device 1.2
  [opencl:cpu:1] Intel(R) OpenCL, AMD Ryzen 7 5800X 8-Core Processor 3.0
  [ext_oneapi_cuda:gpu:0] NVIDIA CUDA BACKEND, NVIDIA T600 0.0 [CUDA 11.5]
  ```

### 2. Select target device in SYCL project

- set integer platform_id and device_id for targetting different backends("DeviceSelect" in json file or option: -dev)

  ````C++
  auto device = sycl::platform::get_platforms()[platform_id].get_devices()[device_id];
  sycl::queue q(device);
  ````

## 3. Compile and usage of this project

### 3.1. Read root <XFLUIDS/CMakeLists.txt>

- CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE is set to "Release" by default, SYCL code would target to host while ${CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE}==Debug
- set INIT_SAMPLE as the problem being tested, path to "species_list.dat" and "reaction_list.dat" should be given to MIXTURE_MODEL
- MPI and AWARE-MPI support added in project, AWARE_MPI need specific GPU-ENABLED mpi version, details referenced in [4-mpi-libs]("4. MPI libs")
- VENDOR_SUBMIT allows throwing some parallism tuning cuda/hip model to their GPU, only supportted by AdaptiveCpp compile environment

### 3.2. BUILD and RUN

- #### 3.2.1.Build with cmake
- build with cmake

  ````bash
  cd ./XFLUIDS
  mkdir build && cd ./build && cmake .. && make -j
  ````
- #### 3.2.2.Local machine running
- XFLUIDS automatically read <XFLUIDS/settings/*.json> file depending on INIT_SAMPLE setting

  ````bash
  ./XFLUIDS
  ````
- Append options to XFLUIDS in cmd for another settings, all options are optional, all options are listed in [6. executable file options]("6. Executable file options")

  ````bash
  ./XFLUIDS -dev=1,1,0
  mpirun -n mx*my*mz ./XFLUIDS -mpi=mx,my,mz -dev=1,0,0
  ````
- #### 3.2.2.Slurm sbatch running on Hygon(KunShan) supercompute center

  ````bash
  cd ./XFLUIDS/scripts/KS-DCU
  sbatch ./1node.slurm
  sbatch ./2node.slurm
  ````

## 4. MPI libs
### 4.1. Set MPI_PATH browsed by cmake before build

- cmake system of this project browse libmpi.so automatically in path of ${MPI_PATH}/lib, please export MPI_PATH to the mpi you want:

  ````cmd
  export MPI_PATH=/home/ompi
  ````
### 4.2. The value of MPI_HOME, MPI_INC, path of MPI_CXX(libmpi.so/linmpicxx.so) output on screen while it is found

````cmake
  -- MPI settings:
  --   MPI_HOME:/home/ompi
  --   MPI_INC: /home/ompi/include added
  --   MPI_CXX lib located: /home/ompi/lib/libmpi.so found
````

## 5. .json configure file arguments

- reading commits in src file: <${workspaceFolder}/src/read_ini/settings/read_json.cpp>

## 6. Executable file options

| name of options |                                       function                                       |    type    |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------: | :---------: |

| -run            |   domain resolution and running steps: X_inner,Y_inner,Z_inner,nStepmax(if given)    |     int     |
| -blk            | initial local work-group size, dim_blk_x, dim_blk_y, dim_blk_z,DtBlockSize(if given) |     int     |
| -dev            |             device counting and selecting: device munber,platform,device             |     int     |
| -mpi            |                             mpi cartesian size: mx,my,mz                             |     int     |
| -mpi-s          |                                  "weak" or "strong"                                  | std::string |
| -mpidbg         |         append the option with or without value to open mpi multi-rank debug         | just append |

## 7. Output data format

- ###### Set "OutDAT", "OutVTI" as 1 in .json file
### 7.1. Tecplot file

- import .dat files of all ranks of one Step for visualization, points overlapped between boundarys of ranks(3D parallel tecplot format file visualization is not supportted, using tecplot for 1D visualization is recommended)

### 7.2. VTK file

- use `paraview` to open `*.pvti` files for MPI visualization(1D visualization is not allowed, using paraview for 2/3D visualization is recommended);
